"""One-time Spotify authorization.

Run once, interactively. It opens a browser, you consent, and it writes
`SPOTIFY_TOKEN_JSON` straight into your `.env` — no separate token file. The
bot re-reads it (and rewrites it in place after each refresh) from there onward.

    python -m brain.authorize_spotify            # the Web API token (controls playback)
    python -m brain.authorize_spotify --player   # the bot's own player (librespot)

The two are separate sign-ins because they're separate things: the token lets
the bot *tell* a device what to play; the player *is* a device. Sign both in
to the same Spotify account, or the player won't appear in that account's
device list.

Kept out of the agent path on purpose: a bot that can pop a browser consent
screen mid-conversation is a bot that hangs waiting for a click nobody saw.
