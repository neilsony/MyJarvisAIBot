"""Google Calendar, through Google's own client libraries.

Deliberately *not* an MCP server. A third-party calendar MCP server runs in
your process holding live OAuth tokens for your real calendar — the trust
boundary is someone else's release cadence. This keeps that boundary inside
code you own. The generic MCP client comes later, for servers where third-party
code is the actual point.

Credentials are plain environment variables (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`,
`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_TOKEN_JSON`) in `.env`, not a client-secrets
JSON file or a separate token file — one place to look, one file to protect.
The token is the one value here that legitimately changes at runtime: it's
rewritten in place via `set_env_value` after each refresh.

**Scope is `calendar.events`** — the narrowest scope Google offers that still
permits writes. It cannot read Drive, read Gmail, change calendar sharing, or
enumerate your other calendars. Everything here operates on `primary`.

**Still no delete tool.** This is driven by a voice loop that mishears things.
Creating a wrong event leaves a visible artifact you can spot and remove;
silently destroying a real one does not.

**Update exists, scoped to title and time only** — not location, not color,
not attendees. A misheard update to a real existing event is a real risk, but
narrower fields mean a narrower blast radius, and "move this to 5" is common
enough to be worth that risk. Deleting stays out for now.
