"""Spotify playback, through the Web API via spotipy.

Deliberately *not* an MCP server, for the same reason as Calendar: a live OAuth
token for a real account stays inside code you own.

**Playback only** — play, pause, resume, skip. No volume, no queue, no liking
tracks or editing playlists. Playing the wrong song is undone in a second;
a misheard "add this to my running playlist" leaves a quiet mess nobody
notices for weeks. That's the same blast-radius argument that keeps Calendar
without a delete tool.

**No confirmation step**, unlike Calendar's writes. Every action here is
instantly reversible, and a desk robot that asks "are you sure?" before
skipping a track is a desk robot you stop talking to.

The Web API doesn't play audio; it tells a Spotify device what to play, and
it requires Premium. When the bot's own player is set up (see
`brain.spotify_player`), play and resume always go to it — no guessing.
Otherwise the target is the active device, else the one named by
`SPOTIFY_DEVICE_NAME` (an optional tiebreaker), else whichever open device
Spotify lists first.

Credentials are plain environment variables in `.env`, like Google's — one
place to look, one file to protect. Unlike Calendar, the token can't just be
refreshed once at startup: Spotify access tokens last an hour and the Brain
runs for days. So spotipy refreshes on demand through a cache handler whose
"cache" *is* `SPOTIFY_TOKEN_JSON`, rewritten in place via `set_env_value`.

Known limit: Spotify blocks new API apps from its own algorithmic playlists
(Discover Weekly and friends). Neil's own playlists work; those may not.
